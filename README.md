# 📌 3D Surface Integral Visualizer

A simple yet powerful Python project that **visualizes the concept of a surface integral** using 3D vector field rendering.

This tool illustrates how a vector field like **F(x, y, z) = ⟨x, y, 1⟩** flows through a flat surface in 3D space and helps you understand **flux**, **dot product**, and **surface normal** with clarity.

> 🎯 Designed with the need of getting the concept right from electrodynamics vector calculus!

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Surface integrals are often introduced with tough math, making them hard to visualize. I built this project to bridge the gap between:

- **Pure mathematical formulas**  
  \[
  \Phi = \iint_S \vec{F} \cdot \hat{n} \, dA
  \]
- and **visual understanding**: how vectors “pierce” through a surface.

Many people learn the math, but **don’t develop intuition**. This project aims to fix that.
